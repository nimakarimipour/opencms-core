        Your next step is to explore the OpenCms workplace.
         The OpenCms workplace is where you can edit existing pages, create new pages, manage
        users etc. The workplace has been tested with recent versions of <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Firefox</b>,
        <b>Edge</b> and <b>Safari</b> browsers. Internet explorer 11 also works but is not recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Please note:</i> The browser requirements apply <i>only</i>
        when accessing the OpenCms workplace. For websites
        built with Alkacon OpenCms, there are no such restrictions.
    </p>
