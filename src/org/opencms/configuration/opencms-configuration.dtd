# in the configuration node. This allows better separation of the
# Java code functionality.
#
# You must provide the name of a class that provides the 
# org.opencms.configuration.I_CmsXmlConfiguration interface.
#
# You can also optionally provide the location of a file in the "real" 
# file system that contains the XML. If you do not provide this attribute,
# the instantiated configuration class must provide the file name.
